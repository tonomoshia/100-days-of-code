# 2nd Round of #100DaysOfCode

#### Day 1 (July 17, 2017)

##### Coding
In Udemy [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) I completed lecture 31 wherein we created a child theme manually.

R2D1 #100DaysOfCode Created a WordPress child theme manually.

##### Reading for #DeepWork

Finished Deep Work by Cal Newport yesterday, so dived back into [The Lean Startup: How Today's Entrepreneurs Use Continuous Innovation to Create Radically Successful Businesses by Eric Reis](http://amzn.to/2sXgFGV) today.

#### Day 2 (July 18, 2017)

##### Coding

In Udemy [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) I completed lecture 32 wherein we created a child theme with a plugin called Child Theme Configurator. Created a child theme for my class website and for my own website as well.

Problem is after creating the child themes and activating them, both yesterday and today, the change he asked us to make, did not show up on the websites. A border bottom is supposed to change from gray to white and it just is not changing. Haven't figured out what I am doing wrong.

Having many problems with Local by Flywheel application that is making working with my sites very difficult. Keeps giving errors and making it impossible to access site or admin panel.

Last night I installed DesktopServer, another older local WordPress development solution. So far it is working okay.When Local is working going to a a backup and restore it to a DesktopServer WordPress installation.

Update: ugh . . .  That doesn't work. I think you only get to import sites when you upgrade to Desktop Server Pro.

Macbook has also been very slow lately. Everything takes a very long time to open, decreasing my output significantly.I have been looking at eBay for a 2013 or later MBP. I also went to Apple website but I don't want their stupid touchbar and the prices are astronomical, even with student discount.

One thing positive --- Loving my new vertical mouse I bought on Prime Day. It is making navigation of the screen so much easier.

R2D2 #100DaysOfCode Created child theme with a plugin. Had problems afterwards with getting CSS changes to show on site. Will keep at it.

##### Reading for #DeepWork
Going through my highlights in Deep Work to pull out the "10 Things I Learned from Deep Work".

Continuing to read The Lean Startup. Not very deeply. Have lost interest in this book TBH.

#### Day 3 (July 19, 2017)

Requested a restart of my Skillcrush Front End Development/WordPress Blueprint course. They have completely revamped it so I would like to do the new one.

Still having problems with my Local by Flywheel installations. Read on the forum that many are having same problems. Someone mentioned that an update should fix the problem. I seem to remember a recent update that Local initiated, but I am going to try it anyway.

Today's task in lecture 33 of Udemy [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) is to alter admin page by editing functions.php file in the child them documents. We shall see if I get to carry that out . . .

Wasted my lunch hour trying to fix this issue. Stuck on "Verifying Local by Flywheel.app" for 30 minutes. Had same problem when installing Microsoft Office. Now that it's been verified and has opened it is just a white screen of sadness. And now I have to attend a meeting. Hopefully I can come back to this and be productive today.

Yay, took forever to open my sites but Local is working again. Thank you Universe!

OMG my changes to child theme CSS finally show up now. I was feeling a bit lost yesterday; now I know it wasn't my fault.

Also the alteration to the admin page for today (hiding the users menu) worked as well. Today is a good day. I just wish I could have gotten more done in this period of time.

R2D3 #100DaysOfCode Had to reinstall @HeyFlywheel's Local . Then learned how to alter admin panel by editing functions.php of child theme.

#### Day 4 (July 20, 2017)

##### Coding

Restarted my Skillicrush WordPress Blueprint. The Udemy course is a little too breezy about the MAMP way of local development, so I am going to go the MAMP route with Skillcrush instead. I uninstalled my prior MAMP installations (all 3 of them) and deleted all my prior Skillcrush WordPress files for a fresh start.

MAMP installation takes a long time but once it's installed I don't remember ever not being able to access my local site. I can't say the same for Local by Flywheel lately. That's why I want to make sure I know how to go the MAMP route when I have to.

After waiting 40 minutes to install MAMP, being told that "Apache couldn't be started because port 888 is in use by some other software." Probably Local or Desktop Server.

Local is killing me!! Or maybe my macbook pro is asking for compassionate euthanasia.

I think DesktopServer is the one using the port 8888  because it runs with Apache and Local uses Nginix.

Yes . . .  confirmed. DesktopSerer is using that port. I wish I could make it stop opening sites in Safari. I do not use Safari. (It's super slow, although I did read somewhere that Chrome slows your computer down and you should use Safair instead. I did not find that to be the case.) I will figure it out later--getting DesktopServer to open in Chrome instead.

AAAHHH. DestopServer is XAMPP in disguise. Now things make more sense.

Going to make the Skillcrush WordPress site in XAMPP/Desktop Server instead.

Arrrgggh! I forgot DesktopServer free version does not let you import a site. So I will uninstall DesktopServer and reinstall MAMP and start over. This crap is an all-day affair.

Being home with a sick baby gave me time for all this.

Okay did that and MAMP still serving same Apache error message.

Now checking VirtualBox and it says it needs an update.

Shutdown and restarted and now MAMP works. But Local still doesn't.

###### Error Message:

Local Router Error

Our apologies for the inconvenience. The Local router is not able to connect to the site you requested.

We suggest you try the following:

Restart Site - Go to the Local by Flywheel app and restart the site you are attempting to access.

At least MAMP is up and running and I was able to spin up a site on that.

R2D4 #100DaysOfCode Wrangling with some local WordPress development tool issues. I missed the days when things just worked (last week!).

##### Deep Work

Started reading a new book last night. It is not on my list. Just released on Amazon, by John Somnez. [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo). I find his videos and blogs very valuable.

##### More Coding

Went through a week of Skillcrush WordPress Blueprint, which included a clean MAMP/SQL/WordPress install and some changes in admin panel. Then I was able to do a clean install of the Fireweed Photo website I have been working on for the Udemy course. And a migration so I am back where I was 2 days ago. Yay.

Need to also make a Fireweed Photo staging site.

#### Day 5 (July 21, 2017)

##### Coding

Returned to Udemy [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) and completed lecture 34 where we work with customizing the Genesis child theme Parallax Pro. This is our first time working in the student sandbox which has a bunch of premium themes and plugins that we can work with (try out) without having to buy them.

##### Deep Work

Continuing to read John Somnez's book, [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo).

##### More Coding at Home

One more day's work of Skillcrush WordPress Blueprint.

Investigated underscores starter theme. (Learned about that at a meetup a couple of months and listened to a podcast about it last week.)


#### Day 6 (July 22, 2017)
Woke up this a.m. to a dead laptop charger. üò£ Ordered new one coming in 2 days. #100DaysOfCode forced break unless I can use another machine.

Saturday Coding Club. My dead charger prevented me from working on my laptop today. Had to work on my iMac before club.

R2D6 #100DaysOfCode Used another mac to work in my WordPress sandbox.  @ Coding Club we learned how to start up Rails app w/ Docker.

Also continued reading [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo) to 10%.

#### July 23, 2017

Skipped a day. My Dad has come to visit me this week from out of town. Today was his first day.

#### Day 7 (July 24, 2017)

Finished lecture 35 of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) on making changes to site with Genesis theme. We added CSS styles using plugins rather than making changes to Genesis child theme.

Also continued reading [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo) to 17%.

More work at night on lecture 36 of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) about adding to functions.php of child theme through plugins rather than changing child theme functions.php directly. This avoids having to re-do changes after a theme is updated.

Non-Genesis use "Code Snippets" plug-in. For WordPress websites using Genesis framework, use [WP Clips](https://wpclips.net).

R2D7 #100DaysOfCode #WordPress Learned how to add to CSS styles & functions.php using plugins to avoid editing a child theme directly.

#### July 25, 2017 and July 26, 2017

Another day off. Took the fam to Lion Country Safari. No time to code after.

#### Day 8 (July 27, 2017)

Playing with code snippets in functions.php of my child theme.

Also continued reading [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo) to 22%.

#### Day 9 (July 28, 2017)

Completed 45% of [Codecademy's](https://www.codecademy.com/learn) PHP course. Earned 10 badges.

******

#### Day 10 (July 29, 2017)

Attended two Meetups today:

* [South FLorida Agile Association Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/South-Florida-Agile-Association/), SFAA Appreciation & Organization Day!, where we talked about the direction the group is going in and how we can improve it. An event aggregrator was much wanted. Also wanting SFAA to take the role as being the umbrella for other local Agile groups. Unclear how other AGile groups will react to that. SOunds a bit like when Cersei or Dany ask you to bend the knee and pledge your loyalty. We will see. Anyway this inspired me to try to make a new SFAA website since their is outdated and stale. Started it when I got to coding club early.
* [Saturday Coding Club](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/) where we started work on a group project: a website for our group made with Ruby on Rails. Github repo created and static home page created. We were made collaborators. We also started using our own slack channel within the Wyncode Tech Slack. We also discovered we had a website already made by Damon, but it is basic, outdated and hasn't been touch in eons. It is a github page at [Broward Ruby Brigade](http://www.broward-rb.org/).

Created new WordPress site where I am going to try to create an event aggregator for local Agile groups. Also experimenting with Beaver Builder plugins.

##### Tweets

Using a discipline like #100DaysOfCode is what helps me go to my computer to work after the kids have gone to sleep, instead of Netflix.

R2D10 #100DaysOfCode #WordPress Started on a new website for local agile group. Trying to aggregate all local events to better community.

(_reply to my tweet_) @chznbaum: That sounds like such a great idea! Folks often get discouraged by how much research is needed to keep up with local events.

(_my reply_) Yes, we found a lot of pain points with that. Plus conflicting dates up the wazoo because there is no communication or coordination.

R2D10 #100DaysOfCode #ruby We started working on a group project - a website for the Coding Club. Very meta.

#### Day 11 (July 31)

Excited that my new MacBook Pro is coming tomorrow. Gives me a reason to be happy to go to work after a week of vacation.

Pared down my meetups groups to really focus on what I am interested in.

Downloaded some Sitepoint books and sent them to my Kindle Paperwhite so I always have something on topic to read.

Listened to a Complete Developer Podcast with John Sonmez as the guest. He is the author of the book I have been reading: [The Complete Software Developer's Career Guide: How to Learn Programming Languages Quickly, Ace Your Programming Interview, and Land Your Software Developer Dream Job ](http://amzn.to/2vsRleo).

Worked at night on [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content).

* Lecture 37 was about WPMUDev.org premium plugins that can help you build incredible websites.
* Lecture 38 was about Envato Marketplace for themes (ThemeForest) and plugins (CodeCanyon).
* Lecture 39 is about choosing between free and premium plugins and how to choose between plugins based on reviews, active installs, last update, and responsiveness of plugin developer.
* Lecture 40 is about learning how to assess the performance of your plugins so you do not slow down your site. P3 - Plugin Performance Profiler from GoDaddy.  _Found this to be not very useful as the only plugin it seems to find is itself._ Also hasn't been updated for two years. Also tried out two plugins to improve photo galleries:
  - Simple Lightbox (higher plugin load time than the next one)
  - Responsive Lightbox
  - WP Tiles
Deactivating Child Theme Configurator because we have already made the CHild Theme and don't need to use it anymore.
* Lecture 41, we compared a premium plugin to its lite version. Using Soliloquy Responsive Slider. My slider is not showing up!!!!! :-(

Saw a plugin I am going to investigate later: _WordPress Backup to Dropbox_.

#### Day 12 (July 31, 2017)

New MacBook Pro was delivered today. Have been setting it up, including the development environment.  Installed MAMP and moved my 3 local WordPress websites to the new MacBook. Installed Docker. Yay!

Also installed must-haves: Sublime, Gitkraken, Evernote, MAMP, Chrome & Firefox. And FileZilla, Alfred 3, GIMP, a Pomodoro timer, Calibre, Spectacle and Slack.

Oh happy day! New MBP arrived. Using my lunch hour to set it up just right. #100DaysOfCode

#### Day 13 (August 1, 2017)

Lecture 43 of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) where we are starting a completely new site with Executive Pro theme from StudioPress. As a sidenote, I am 49% complete with this course. Woo hoo!

Attended webinar about managing remote employees from CEB. 

#### Day 14 (August 2, 2017)

Lecture 44 of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content)  where we are configuring a Genesis theme (Executive Pro) with the Genesis Responsive Slider Plugin. Also used Regenerate Thumbnails plugin (free!) to get images ready for responsive slider. Also configured Genesis widgets to create home page. 

##### Tweet
R2D13 R2D14 #100 DaysOfCode Learning how to use the widgets  that come with Genesis #WordPress themes to make the homepage look amazing.

#### Day 15 (August 3, 2017)

Lectture 45 of   [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content)  where we experimented with Genesis column classes and [StudioPress CSS gists on Github](https://gist.github.com/studiopress/6602811) to edit formatting of pages. 

Answered some questions on the Udemy course question page about Local by Flywheel. Installed Local by Flywheel on my new Macbook Pro. Going to give it another shot. Maybe my old computer just couldn't handle it for some unknown reason. I say this because Local continues to work on my iMac.

Tried out the BackWPup plugin on my SFAA WordPress site. My first time uploading a zip file to install a plugin. Pretty easy. Configuring the plugin took some time but in the end I was able to to have it send backup files to my Dropbox, something you need the pro version of All-In-One Migration to do. So now, I am going to try that with my Fireweed Photo WordPress site (MAMP installation), the only one I was unable to migrate form old MBP to new MBP due to All-In-One Migrations's size limits. They want you to upgrade to pro in order to import larger files and also to have files automatically sent to OneDrive, AWS S3 and/or Dropbox. 

Installed WP-CLI.  OMG, so cool. Just as cool as they said it was at WordCamp Miami. Now I have to read the handbook starting with this: [Quck Start](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/quick-start/).  Next I will read [External Resources: Blog posts, slides and videos from  users](https://make.wordpress.org/cli/handbook/external-resources/).

Experiencing the same problem where my address bar is disappearing on Chrome. Haven't pinpointed when it happens but it is very annoying. 

Attended a WordPress meetup. David Carr told us about how he createda plugin, [RSVPMaker](https://www.rsvpmaker.com) to help Toastmasters groups with therir websites. He also created [WP4Toastmasters](wp4toasters.com).  He also created a theme for this, Lectern.

Made some edits on my local org (South-Florida-Agile-Association) website. Still trying to find that perfect calendar, 

#### Day 16 (August 4, 2017)
Lecture 46 of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) where made tweaks to the navigation menu, header and footer of the ExecutivePro site. Also made a header logo and a tab logo for the site in Photoshop. First time using a transparent background for a Photoshop item. One day, I need to take a class about how to use Photoshop so I can feel more comfortable with it. 

#### Day 17 (August 5, 2017)
Saturday Coding Club. Worked on Codecademy and WordPress. 

##### Tweet
I just unlocked the While Loops in PHP badge on @codecademy! http://www.codecademy.com  via @codecademy #100DaysOfCode #WordPress

#### August 6, 2017
Day off

#### Day 18 (August 7, 2017)

Lecture 47 of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). We learned about Custom Post Types and Taxonomies--including portolio and books using Genesis Author Pro plugin.
CustomPress is a premium plugin from WPMU Dev that allows you to create custome post types and taxonomies in any theme.
A free plugin is Custom Post Type UI (which also has pro version as well). Great one to start with. Better to use custom post type in a plugin rather than through a theme so you don't break your site if you choose to change themes. Best practice accorting to [WordPress Codex on Post Types](https://codex.wordpress.org/Post_Types)

#### Day 19 (August 8, 2017)

Lecture 48  and 49 of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). Populated Executive Pro site with real images and rearranged the homepage using featured posts, which will automaticallyupdate the homepage when a new blog post is published.. Explored post offset system used in Genesis framework and create a blog archive page to display a traditional blog page within theme. We edited the contact form and added a contact form pop-up message.  Also adding a contact form to the footer of every page. 

I have completd 56% of this Udemy course!

#### Day 20 (August 9, 2017)

Lecture 50, 51 and 52 of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content).  We are starting a new site with the StudioPress Genesis child theme, 
Cafe Pro.  Scrolling homepage navigation and customized  layout of interior pages of the theme using 
the Genesis theme setting snad sidebar widgets. Anchor tags for scrolling website design in 
WordPress also explored in our local page using the Non-Genesis Affinity theme. Changed 
that page to a single-scrolling page using Affinity's anchor tag system.
I think I want to change my mom's WordPress site tot eh Affinity theme and make it one-page
scrolling site instead of the 3 pages it is now.

59% complete with the Udemy course. 


#### Day 21 (August 10, 2017)

Lecture 53 of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). 
Learned about [dashicons](https://developer.wordpress.org/resource/dashicons/#pressthis). 
Worked with widgets to edit home page layout on CafePro Genesis framework site.
Editing code in functions.php file to allow for bigger images in the header than the theme defaults allow. You could also use code snippets plugin. 
Find section called "add support for a custome header" and change the numbers in height and width. Changes will be reflected in customizer recommended size for image. 
Basically edited entire website to make it look completely different. 

60% complete with this course. 

#### August 11, 2017
skipped a day

#### Day 22 (August 12, 2017)
Continued making edits tot he [CafePro WordPress page](http://cafeprofem.wpdevcourse.com/). 
Played with a [Fork N Go](http://jlord.us/forkngo/) project for [yet another personal page](https://github.com/tonomoshia/hello-its-me).  

#### August 13, 2017

Skipped aday.

#### Day 23 (August 14, 2017)

Further tweaked my [CafePro WordPress page](http://cafeprofem.wpdevcourse.com/), which uses a lot of premium plugins and a Genesist child theme in the student sandbox. Also emulated with a local WordPress site using Local by Flywheel to install WordPress and Affinity theme to approximate the front page without those premium plugins and the Genesis theme framwork. Defintiely not the the same functionality but still nice way to put a lot of content on one unified page. Have to tweak it some more to get it how I want it. Local has an [live link](http://e074d94b.ngrok.io/) you can enable. 

#### Day 24 (August 15, 2017)

Listened througout the day to a course for people interested in becoming digital nomads: Start a Business & Travel the World in 30 Days. Got through 81% of it before lunch.

Watched Lecture 54 of the [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content) and got some more ideas for my  [CafePro WordPress page](http://cafeprofem.wpdevcourse.com/). In this lecture, he shows us what he did to tweak the website. I didn't use or need all of the things he did, but some i took advantage of, including incline widgets in one section. Before all my widgets were one at a time. I also reworded some sections and improved my menus. 

Watched a webinar about agile: Make Room for the Agile Business Analyst: Tips for Adding Business Analyst Skills to Your Next Project. I attended this because I have been unclear on the place for Business Analysts in the Agile Project. Plainly put, I had no idea what they do and why we would need/want them.

******

#### Day 25 (August 16, 2017)

Created a [test site ](sfaatestsite.wordpress.com) for local agile associiation with the aggregaated calendar we were talking about. I sent it the lead lead organizer and am waiting to hear back. Used [event lists shortcodes](https://en.support.wordpress.com/widgets/upcoming-events/). You can only use these on wordpress.com websites not wordpress.org websites.

Tried out [WPacked](https://github.com/enricodeleo/wpacked) (after reorganizing my Wordpress Trello cards). Set it up but don't know what to with it afterwards. It's a neat idea for local development without a virtual machine. 

"enricodeleo/wpacked: WPacked is a WordPress development starter kit with portability and immediate local development in mind."

#### Day 26  (August 17, 2017)
Did not hear back from RIck about the test site I made. Pretty bummed about that. 
Made a landing page for my nascentTwitter marketing business. Can't do paypal buttons on my wordpress.com tonomoshia.com website without upgrading so I added an order page to a github page I already have and linked to that. 

#### Day 27 (August 18, 2017)

On an involuntary break due to Hurricane Irma.

#### Day 39 (September 16, 2017)
Coding Club was to be today, but the space we use is having issues due to Hurricane Irma, so we cancelled the meetup. Not wanting to lose this time, I headed to the library. They have a co-working space I want to check out as well as a "creation station". My mom is taking a [Introduction to Robotics class](http://ems.browardlibrary.org/MasterCalendar/EventDetails.aspx?data=hHr80o3M7J4PGq%2fFq1URZXTXnjUnnM9ecx1QdzfRVF1w2NCNjmHJSRBnnG2709PX) today at 2 p.m. (!) here.
The [Creation Station](http://www.broward.org/library/creationstation/Pages/Default.aspx) has VR headsets, video games, robotics stuff, guitars,  and green screen for making videos, 3-D printers, computers with larger monitors than the regular computer room here. I am not using any of these things, but it's cool to know they are here.

No Intro to Robotics. Actually attended a meetup of HackMiami.

Lecture 59, Frontend Display of Author Pro website, of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). 


#### Day 41 (September 19, 2017)
Worked on my Twitter Promo website, a github page. 

#### September 20, 2017
Day off

#### Day 42 (September 21, 2017)
WordPress Miami Meetup. Helped explain CSS concept of specificity to a member. 

Worked on my Zebra WordPress practice website. Having problem with updating plugins. Did a download of the site to see if 2nd installation has the same problem. 

#### Day 43 (September 22, 2017)
Lecture 60, AuthorPro Homepage and Book Widget, of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). Customized the homepage using the widget areas. [My AuthorPro website](http://authorprofem.wpdevcourse.com/)

#### Day 44 (September 23, 2017)
Saturday Coding Club. Worked on my [Twitter Promotions website](https://tonomoshia.github.io/twitter-promo/), added a faq page. Drafted and tested emails to send to customers who sign up. Saved the ones that worked in Evernote and in my email box.
Made some changes in CSS that did not take. :-(  The much maligned !important did make it work. Gotta figure out the inheritances. I have normalize and bootstrap enabled so they may be overriding the small changes I wanted to make. 

******

#### Day 45 (September 24, 2017)
Added issues to my github page on Twitter Promo website with changes I want to make. Created a project page with columns for 'to do', 'doing', and 'done'. Made repo private so won't be posting links to repo here anymore because they will not be useful.
Added FAQ to main page. Added some <hr> to separate parts of page. Deleted FAQ page. Added 2nd section with package options after FAQ.
Removed extraneous <div> and <ul> tags that had been commeneted out.

#### Day 46 (September 25, 2017)
Continued working on [Twitter Promotion Page](https://tonomoshia.github.io/twitter-promo/). Centered the footer icons and added space between them.
Also removed "lead" class from top paragraph as this class is now obsolete.
Removed an extraneous icon from the FAQ text. 
Changed background color to be a lighter shade of the Twitter bird color. Slightly darker shade for footer. Decided better of it, because my gold silver and bronze packages do not look the right shade with blue behind them so I changed main background color to a shade of white, with alternating sections being a variant of the Twiiter blue. 
Bought lifetime access from AppSumo for $49 to PromoRepublic as I think it will help me with the Twitter Promo business. 
Changed some fonts. Still not happy with it. 

#### Day 47 (September 26, 2017)
Familiarizing myself with PromoRepublic. Watched video on graphic editor and tinkered with editorial calendar. Made a post. 
Class at main library: Introduction to Adobe Creative Cloud. Hoping to figure out Photoshop now that I have been paying for it for a year already. 
DIscovered two things: (1) the existence of Adobe Muse CC and (2) the library has 4 huge iMacs with the entire Adobe Creative Cloud suite installed and open to anyone with a library card to use at the Creation Station on the 1st floor. Like Manna from heaven, OMG. SO when Adobe cuts me off from the student rate (10 bucks) I can come to the library and go hog wild creating, well, anything really! Plus they have people there who know how to use it who can help you. I think I will start hanging out at the Creation Station for a couple of hours before Coding Club on Saturdays from now on. They have everything there. 
Paid for a $paybyname for accepting bitcoin payments. [$tonomoshia](https://www.coinpayments.net/$tonomoshia) from [CoinPayments](https://www.coinpayments.net) because it would be cool to one day be able to accept bitcoin in payment for my work. Did not realize I would have to renew it every year, but it cheap ($3.74 after transaction fees).

#### Day 48 (September 27, 2017)
Made more changes to my [Twitter Promotion Page](https://tonomoshia.github.io/twitter-promo/). Haven't pushed them to master as I am not sure I like them. 
FInaly got my <hr> styling to work by making everything !important, but it looks childish and amateurish. Why did I pick that? LOL. Not keeping that. Commenting out the CSS for the <hr> element.
Tried to make the type bolder and easier to read (at least for me), but I think I went too far. 
Something I did is keeping my footer from being centered like it was before. Very annoying. 

Tried out Adobe Spark, which is apparently included in my Adobe CC package. Never heard of it before. It is a way to build webspages without any code. It's a bit limited. Recreated my Twitter Promo page in it, but was not able to include the Paypal payment buttons. [My Adobe Spark](https://spark.adobe.com/page/LIedFVWG7ql54/). One idea is to just include a link to another page which would have only the packages and the payment button on it, none of the other copy which was already on the Adobe Spark page. 

#### Day 49 (September 28, 2017)
Lecture 61, Further AuthorPro Customizations, of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). Styled the footer and after entry widgets. [My AuthorPro website](http://authorprofem.wpdevcourse.com/)

Got my footer on my [Twitter Promotion Page][4] to be centered again. Commented all of the CSS relating to the <footer> element and then added <center> again. Not sure why that didn't work yesterday or if I even did that yesterday. I'm keeping the bold type. It's just on the package section. 

******

#### Day 50 (September 29, 2017)
Deleted a Tweet that had been rejected by Twitter from my SocialOomph queue. The one ablout tweeting 3-10 times a day. Hmmmm.
Lecture 62, Book Cover using the PSD Template, of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course][2]. Editing a book cover in Photoshop CC. [My AuthorPro website][3]
Watched a Webinar with David about Data Science from one of the Udemy teachers he is learning from. Downloaded Tableau Public to try it out. 

#### September 30, 2017
Absoultely nothing as I had a hangover from partying last night after that lovely webinar. Bailed on coding club and spent the day in slovenliness, plus taking care of kids. So not that much slovenliness, really. Just no coding that I can recall. 

#### October 1, 2017
*Another* day off. 

#### Day 51 October 2, 2017
* Bought StudioPress Pro Plus plan at a discounted rate ($374 instead of $499). Now I have to get a gig, for real for real!!!!!!
* Lecture 63, Change Themes Preserving CPT Data, of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course][2].  wherein we blow up our page by choosing a different theme (interior) and then have to put it back together again. Mostly by moving around widgets that got put down willy nilly by the new theme and recreating some that disappeared completely. 
* With my new StudioPress Genesis framework license, I created a new Local By Flywheel site I called Genesis and I installed a Genesis theme and attempted to make an order page. It's pretty complicated using WooCommerce and whatnot.  Tried it also with just the Paypal buttons I already have and that works pretty well, so not wure why I need WooCommerce. Probably don't for 3 products. It is kinda overkill.

#### Day 52 (October 3, 2017)
* Lecture 64, Two Types of Internal Email: Transactional and Marketing of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course][2].
* Attended webinar on Overcoming Virtual Team Challenges with Heidi Araya of PhishMe.
* Continued working on StudioPress website.

#### Day 53 (October 4, 2017)
Bitcoin.
Worked on my genesis.dev Local by Flywheel site.  Downloaded all the Genesis Studio Press themes I have access to.

#### Day 54 (October 5, 2017)
* WordPress Meetup. Learned a lot. Top 9 was so good today. 
* I volunteered to work on WordCamp Miami (March 2017). Will be working with Rick Tuttle and hoping to learn a lot and make good contacts. Such a great opportunity.
* Worked on my Bluehost site and my Genesis .dev site, previewing changes and adding new plugins.

******

#### Day 55 (October 6, 2017)

* Connected with Rick Tuttle over email regarding volunteering with WordCamp Miami.
* Completed Lecture 16 of [Run an Auto Pilot Twitter Marketing Service with SocialOomph](https://www.udemy.com/twitter-marketing-service-home-business/learn/v4/content) about "Finding Clients with Twitter Search". Created spreadsheet for keeping track of search results (leads).
* Worked on new iteration of Twitter Promo website, not a live link yet. Deleted genesis.dev Local by Flywheel site as plugins were all malfunctioning. 

#### Day 56 (October 7, 2017)
##### Done: 
* Lecture 65, Email Addresses at Private Domains, of  [Complete WordPress Website Business Course][2].  
* I set up a free MailChimp account and an email address at my tonomoshia.com domain. 

* Explored using Genesis theme framework with Beaver Builder.

* Created a [poopy.life instant WP install](http://dizzy-kinkajou.w4.poopy.life/) to try out Gutenberg. Using Interior Pro Genesis theme.

##### Reading

* [Demo Video: Using Beaver Builder with the Genesis WordPress Theme](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/genesis/)

* [Beaver Builder Reveiw from a Developer's Perspective](https://carriedils.com/beaver-builder-review-developer/)

* Discovered the [Genesis Theme Chooser](https://genesisclubbers.com/genesis-child-theme-chooser/). Liking Infinity Pro. Tried live preview on my Zebras! practice site. It does not allow you to change the fonts so I am liking it a lot less.

* Also read about being married to a theme: [If you use the Divi theme with WordPress, it better be forever](http://chrislema.com/divi-theme-forever/). Not a happy marriage. There's a lot to consider when you use a theme like this or a page builder. If you decide to stop using them, or maybe theystop supporting them and something goes wrong, there is a lot of work involved in extricating yourself from the tangled web you have weaved, no pun intended.


#### October 8, 2017
Nada. Zilch.

#### Day 57 (October 9, 2017)

##### Done: 
* Lecture 66, Transactional Email Setup with Google, of [Complete WordPress Website Business Course](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-wordpress-website-business-course/learn/v4/content). 

* Asked flywheel to migrate my tonomoshia.com wordpress.com website to a wordpress.org website. I'm tired of playing around on other websites. I want to make MY website awesome and do the things I can't do now with it. Decided theire high price is worth it for what they offer. Plus they make it esy to hand off sites to clients.

* [How to Manage 50 WordPress Websites](http://highfive.getflywheel.com/hubfs/manage-50-sites.pdf?t=1507574857705)

##### Watched: 
* Gitlab Livestream:  #CompleteDevOps: a GitLab live event with GitLab CEO Sid Sijbrandij and guest hosts, The Changelog's Adam Stacoviak and Jerod Santo as we share some exciting company news, our vision for Complete DevOps, and host a live Q&A session.


#### Day 58 (October 10, 2017)
##### Done: 
Worked on enabling transactional email on my bluehost paralegalprogrammer.com wordpress site. SInce Postman no longer exists and the tutorial was based on that, it didn't go too swimmingly using Gmail SMTP which has some negatives. 

##### Reading: 
[Why Freelancing is Perfect for Introverts](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/292853)

#### Day 59 (October 11, 2017)

Flywheel migrated my website but they did a pretty bad job of it. Sent me 7 pieces of what? It's a mess.  Decided to go through with the wordpress.org guided transfer ($129). That seems to be going well. Pus they will handle the site redirects. I realize it seems silly for the few followers and few views that I have but I want to keep the little bit I have started with and not start from scratch. Next decision is which amazing theme to pick out. Woo hoo!. Can't wait until they are done and I can work on my real website and incorporate my Twitter Promo page into it. (Couldn't do that on a Wordpres.com site as they won't allow paypal buttons unless you upgrade to a premium site and that seemed like going further down the wordpress.com rabbit hole which is the opposite of what I want to do.)

******

#### Day 60 (October 12, 2017)
Worked on transfer of my WordPress site with Bluehost.

#### Day 61 (October 13, 2017)
Client research for twitter promotion business. 
Guided transfer of WordPress website is complete! Yay!!!!!
Webinar on Full Stack Development Using the MEAN Stack. (Bored me to tears. Tapped out early.)
Working on my website. SO far, no theme plays nice. It's clear I need to some heavy editing of content too. 

#### Day 62 (October 14, 2017)

Whatever I was doing today, I think I broke my site. Why can't WordPress have staging built in . Ugh!
Update: I got it to work . . . somehow. 
Using the CafePro Genesis child theme. Not entirely happy with it . . . to be honest I preferred the look of my website with the Truly Minimal theme I had when it was a wordpress.com but since I was so limited there I had to make the jump. 

#### October 15, 2017
Day off, I think. Can' t remember doing anything productive. 

#### Day 63 (October 16, 2017)
More work on my [site][1], specifically the Twitter Promtional pages, (Main, Order, FAQ, Contact) and making certain sidebar items show up only on certain pages. Also making sure the Paypal buttons work. 

Joining [WPMUDev]() for free for 30 days so I can try out all of their plugins. You can keep the ones you use even if you cancel. Charging date is November 16. Started [WPMU Academy course for WordPress Development for Beginners](https://premium.wpmudev.org/academy/courses/wordpress-development-for-beginners-3/).

I need to work on my ssl certificate. I have one but when I go to my page at work it marks it as an unsafe site and says it is not https which it is. Will ask my happiness engineer about it since i have two weeks of support with them. 

Attended Miami Ruby Brigade Meetup. Bryce was giving a talk on Docker for Rubyists. 

#### Day 64 (October 17, 2017)

MIcrosoft Professional Front End Web Development class on EdX. 

Happiness Engineer is working on my SSL certificate problem. It was fixed by bluehost by nightime.

Finished first video from [WPMU Academy course for WordPress Development for Beginners](https://premium.wpmudev.org/academy/courses/wordpress-development-for-beginners-3/) about HTML, CSS, jQuery and PHP.

#### Day 65 (October 18, 2017) 

Continued working on my  [site][1].  
******
#### Day 66 (October 19, 2017)
Continued working on my  [site][1]. I was trying out some accordion plugins for my FAQ. I think I will skip that for now as I'm not sure I want my FAQ to be an accordion. May just be annoying to the user. 

##### Reading/Watching and Doing

* [Setting up Webpack, Babel and React from scratch, revisited](https://stanko.github.io/webpack-babel-react-revisited/) Ultimately it did not work because npm could not find this module: lib/polyfills and the tutorial makes no mention of it. Neither do any of the commenters. I added a comment as he said to do if you have a problem executing the tutorial.

* [Modern JavaScript Explained For Dinosaurs](https://medium.com/@peterxjang/modern-javascript-explained-for-dinosaurs-f695e9747b70?ref=webdesignernews.com)
* Started 2nd section of [WPMU Dev Academy course for WordPress Development for Beginners][6]
* Been listening to some great tech and agile podcasts in the car. I was in this habit and then fell out of it. Now that [WLRN](https:www.wlrn.org) is having what seems likely their quarterly fund drive, I powered up ye olde podcasts and I really love listening to them again. 

#### Day 67 (October 20, 2017) 

##### Reading/Watching and Doing

- [Codecademy's Mastering Markdown](https://www.codecademy.com/courses/web-intermediate-en-Bw3bg/0/1)
- Signed up for Asana to use on projects with clients. 
- Downloaded Client Onboarding Questionnaire to use as framework for mine. Now I need two typeforms.
- Paul Minors has Asana Training Videos series. I watched the first 3:

    - Video: [10 Reasons Why Asana is the Best Project Management Tool](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jhj7VNPB7x8)
    - Video: [How to Set Up Your Brand New Asana Account](https://youtu.be/hf2gNVehpuc)
    - Video: [How to Use Asana Througout the Day](https://youtu.be/sQzqLkOobWM)

Just discovered WuFoo Forms integrates with Asana. Maybe I will make WuFoo forms instead of typeforms. 

Okay I created a WuFoo form and embedded on my site. Made a whole page for it. What is not cool is that the whole page does not show up. Client might give up a the end when the submit button is not clearly present. You have to fill in type, tab and then it shows up. I'm going to see what happens if I just link to the form instead of embedding it. 

On another note, the integration with Asana works beautiffuly. I will know right away if a client fills out a form and it makes itself a task. Sweet!

Yes, the link for the [Wufoo Form][5] is much better than putting the form on my [WordPress site][1]. I would rather have the client stay on my page, but not if it is going to look like crap. 

#### Day 68 (October 21, 2017) 

##### Saturday Coding Club

- 2nd video of [WPMU Academy Dev course for WordPress Development for Beginners][6]

- Learned more about using Asana to manage projects with excerpts of [Nesha Woolery's Organize & Automate Course](http://learnwithnesha.com/courses/organize-automate/lectures/1073597).
- Decreased size of database by having  paralegalprogrammer staging site removed by Bluehost.
- Added "about me" to menu under "home" on my [site][1].
- Optimized photos with WP Smush Pro on my [site][1] in an attempt to decrease size of website to be within All-In-One Migration size limits (512 mb). DId not help much.

- Removed studio press footer on my [site][1].

#### Day 70 (October 24, 2017)

- Reinstalled some WPMU Dev plugins I had jettisoned in an effort to decrease size of my website. 
- Rewatched beginning of and continued watching 2nd video of [WPMU Academy Dev course for WordPress Development for Beginners][6] about PHP.

#### Day 72 (October 26, 2017)

- Installed and configured WP Security Coat. Learned about it from a WordPress podcast. 
- Made a self-hosted password for my WordPress site so I will be able to do the staging that was not possible with a wordpress.com login. 
- Installed and Configured WP Optimize which decreased the size of my database by 40%. (Even smaller than yesterday!)
- Created a staging site with Local by Flywheel. Tried 6 different themes and none of them look the way I want. More work will be necessary. 
    - Minimalism Pro
    - Parallax Pro
    - Freelance
    - Twenty Seventeen
    - Truly Minimal (the original one I was using on wordpress.com hosted site
    - Personal Info

#### October 27, 2017

Planned: 

- 12pm:  Code Along of A testimonial slider using CSS Animations and ES6! With Skillcrush. 
- 1pm: Project Management for Everyone: A Non-Technical Approach

What really happened: I didn't do either of those. Forgot about them actually because I spent my lunch hour fighting with Comcast about my cable/internet bill. Hopefully there is a replay for the Project Managment for Everyone webinar. There probably is not for the Code Along. 

What I did do: took my mother out to dinner for her birthday AND applied to the Grow with Google US Scholarship after I got home. It is a Udacity Nanodegreee scholarship. Sounds pretty awesome. 

I'm going to count this as a day off. :-(

#### Day 73 (October 28, 2017)

Today is the last Saturday Coding Club meetup. Now that TRIM Agency is sponsoring it, they want to turn it into something else. That something else would not be loose and relaxed like our Saturday Coding Club. They want to have speakers and whatnot, so no Saturday Coding Club. 

Working on WordCamp Miami 2018 site today. David Bisset wants me to work on  the volunteer page. Added all the organizzers from last year. I need to make an entry for myself.  

As for the font, the main font we were looking at is a paid font, so I am going to find one that is similar. I did add several Google fonts to the Appearance/Fonts section of admin panel. 

Problems encountered: 
- Cafecito Wapuu does not have a gravatar account. I just added his picture, but when you hover over it, it disappears. 
- Melanie Kafka no longer has a picture set up for her gravatar.
- Do not know how to ge the fonts I added to show up on the page after I added them to the Fonts page. Goiing to investigate a little bit before I ask Rick. 

#### Day 74 (October 29, 2017)

Tried out the Adminer plugin I installed yesterday. It allows you to see and work in your database from the WordPress admin panel, without having to go through cPanel on your hosting company's site. That is something that could be dangerous if you don't know what you're doing but I am glad the option is there. I hate Bluehost's cPanel. Nothing is where I think it should be and it takes forever to find what I am looking for. I suppose that is the same for all cPanel enabled hosts. I don't think anything vary from the model. It's one thing that makes Flywheel so attractive. They make administering your website seem easy. 

Did some work work on the 2018 Organizers page for WordCamp Miami. Resized an image and entered in the shortcodes for the organizers to show up organied in teams. 

A lesson in my Skillcrush WordPress Blueprint, "A Whirlwind Introduction to PHP". 

Finally committed to and activated a new theme on [my site][1]. I chose the Genesis "Smart Passive Income" theme. Configured it so it is not longer embarassing. Took about 2 hours. Now all I need to do get some better copy for my 'about me' page and some more posts. Haven's posted since August.  

Used canvas to generate a color scheme based on my profile photos. It allows you to extract colors from any pictrure you upload. Pretty nifty tool: [Canva Color Pallette Generator](https://www.canva.com/color-pallette). The colors are:
- Steel Blue #4891A1
- Tan #D48FB0
- Dark Slate Gray #172020 (did not use this one)
- Rosy Brown #94765A
- Dark Olive Green #735641 (did not use this one either)

Edited last two paragraphs on Twitter Promotions page to make more sense.

#### October 30, 2017

Day off .

Watched OnAgile seminar: Secrets from the Agile Manifesto Authors on Flow. Going to watch one a week. This was an live online confernece that I paid for but did not attend live, so I am committing to watching one a week. This one had some insigt from the original signatories to the Agile Manifesto. I screenshotted some of them.  

The speaker believes the nexus of Agile is in the Dev Ops mindset: Process, People and Tools leading to Flow.

#### October 31, 2017

Day off. 

#### Day 75 (November 1, 2017)

[Blog post](https://tonomoshia.com/new-favorite-podcast/) . . . first one since August. I posted a mini-review of a podcast I started listening to recently, Junior Developer Toolbox. Also updated my 'Favorite Podcasts' page to include this podcast. Interacted with the podcast hosts on their Slack channel. They are pretty cool. As expected. 

Started Udemy course: [Running a Web Development Business: The Complete Guide](https://www.udemy.com/the-complete-guide-to-running-a-web-development-business/learn/v4/).  Experiencing buffering so I downloaded the videos to my phone so I can watch some of them before I go to sleep.

Configured Hummingbird Pro plugin on my [site][1]. 
Configured CustomPress and Hustle Pro plugins and decided not to use them.  Deactivting Smart Crawl for now as it is a duplicate of Yoast SEO, basically, although as a paid plugin, it should have more functionality out of the box.  

Configured Subscribe by Email plugin and created [Subscribers Management Page](https://tonomoshia.com/affiliate-disclaimer/subscribers-management-page/) for subscribers to manage/edit their subscription. 

I will be so sad when my free year of GitKraken Pro is over. Students are so lucky. 

Was not able to go to Unbound Miami conference today. I will go to the 2nd day of the conference tomorrow. 

#### Day 76 (November 2, 2017)

Day 2 of Unbound Miami conference

#### Day 77 (November 3, 2017)

FInished lesson one of Udacity's Intro to HTML & CSS. 

#### Day 78 (November 4, 2017)

[WordPress Theme Workshop](http://davidbisset.com/wordpress-theme-workshop-november-4th-2017/) with David Bisset at Nova Southeastern University. [Agenda](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-IMJ_DuXf2cp_Z9e3OTrMo_eajPAfY4BK1bLhaz16wA/edit?usp=sharing)

#### November 5, 2017
