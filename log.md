**Today's Progress**: Purrfect Match landing page completion in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).

**Thoughts:** This came out great. I will be happy when we learn how to put something behind it (back-end). Worked at [Saturday Coding Club Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/events/239804616/).

**Today's Progress**: small tweak to tonomoshia.github.io

**Thoughts:** I usually take Sundays off (not on purpose, it's just  the trend). I just added one line to my github page to make it more responsive.  Also used a different Bootstrap CDN.

**Today's Progress**: Worked in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** Javascript Script Demo page. Just starting in Javascript. Prior lessons were in HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap).

### Day 66: May 16

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Did [JS Stalker exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/2_JS_Stalker_Exercise) and [Age Calculator exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/3_Age_Calculator) in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp). Added Bootstrap to the html, even though that was not required, because I wanted it to look a certain way. Decided to plunk down the money for [Dain Miller's Advanced Beginner Challenge](http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/). Included a great video ["The Myth of the 'Real Javascript Developer'](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g)." I worked on Colt's course at lunch.
After work I told my family I had a meetup and went to work by myself at a coffeeshop for another hour to start off the Advanced Beginner Challenge. Was disappointed to find that they changed their hours and now close at 8 p.m. That's why  I only got an hour in. I'm going to do it again on Thursday.
