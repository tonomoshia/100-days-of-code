# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I tracked previous days in Basecamp but decided to bow to the protocol and start keeping this log. Will add previous dates if I feel it makes sense at a later time.

### Day 63: May 13, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Purrfect Match landing page completion in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).

**Thoughts:** This came out great. I will be happy when we learn how to put something behind it (back-end). Worked at [Saturday Coding Club Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/events/239804616/).

**Link to work:** [Purrfect Match Landing Page](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/2_CSS_Units/2_Intermediate_CSS/11_Bootstrap_Landing_Page)

### Day 64: May 14, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: small tweak to tonomoshia.github.io

**Thoughts:** I usually take Sundays off (not on purpose, it's just  the trend). I just added one line to my github page to make it more responsive.  Also used a different Bootstrap CDN.

### Day 65: May 15, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: Worked in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** Javascript Script Demo page. Just starting in Javascript. Prior lessons were in HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap).

**Link to work:** [Script Demo](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/1_Script_Demo)

### Day 66: May 16, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Did [JS Stalker exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/2_JS_Stalker_Exercise) and [Age Calculator exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/3_Age_Calculator) in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp). Added Bootstrap to the html, even though that was not required, because I wanted it to look a certain way. Decided to plunk down the money for [Dain Miller's Advanced Beginner Challenge](http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/). Included a great video ["The Myth of the 'Real Javascript Developer'](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g)." I worked on Colt's course at lunch.
After work I told my family I had a meetup and went to work by myself at a coffeeshop for another hour to start off the Advanced Beginner Challenge. Was disappointed to find that they changed their hours and now close at 8 p.m. That's why  I only got an hour in. I'm going to do it again on Thursday.

### Day 67: May 17, 2017
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Boolean Logic and Logical Operators in Colt Steele's course. New concepts: "truthy" and "falsy" values. Falsy values: false, 0, ""(empty string), null, undefined, NaN. Everything else is "truthy".

In Advanced Beginner Challenge, listened to 5 members-only podcasts at work:  (1) Freelancing 101: How to Start Freelancing NOW w/out Knowing Any Programming (2) Updates & the Concept Behind the ABC Course (3) The 1% A Day Formula (4) How to Stop Your Procrastination (5) Mental Framework: KSE - Knowledge, Strategy, Execution. Best ones: Freelancing 101: How to Start Freelancing NOW w/out Knowing Any Programming & The 1% A Day Formula.

Attended learntoprogram.tv's webinar on "Projects and Portfolios: Getting Your First Job in Software".

### Day 70: May 20, 2017

**Today's Progress:** [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course]((https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), day 4 work of [Advanced Beginner Challenge](https://www.advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/), added projects page (privately as I am still working on it) to [tonomoshia.com](http://www.tonomoshia.com). This is Saturday, so I was planning to get a lot done. I was handicapped by the fact that my Macbook Pro charger stopped working after I dropped it last night, so I was unable to get any coding done at Saturday Coding CLub today. I read a book (Remote) and actually finished it, so there's that. I have only been able to work on my iMac. Nothing wrong with that, but I am able to work anywhere with my Macbook Pro.

> "4. Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existenc e is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return."

>   "7. Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts."

When the program is quit, the runtime period ends and the memory used by the program is made available for use by other programs.
