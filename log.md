# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 66: May 16 
<!-- ##### (delete me or comment me out) -->

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Did [JS Stalker exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/2_JS_Stalker_Exercise) and [Age Calculator exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/3_Age_Calculator) in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp). Decided to plunk down the money for [Dain Miller's Advanced Beginner Challenge](http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/). Included a great video ["The Myth of the 'Real Javascript Developer'](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g)." I worked on Colt's course at lunch. 
After work I told my family I had a meetup and went to work by myself at a coffeeshop for another hour to start off the Advanced Beginner Challenge. Was disappointed to find that they changed their hours and now close at 8 p.m. That's why  I only got an hour in. I'm going to do it again on Thursday.
