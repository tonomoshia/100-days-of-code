# 100 Days Of Code - Log

I tracked previous days in Basecamp but decided to bow to the protocol and start keeping this log. Will add previous dates if I feel it makes sense at a later time.

### Day 63: May 13, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Purrfect Match landing page completion in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp).

**Thoughts:** This came out great. I will be happy when we learn how to put something behind it (back-end). Worked at [Saturday Coding Club Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/events/239804616/).

**Link to work:** [Purrfect Match Landing Page](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/2_CSS_Units/2_Intermediate_CSS/11_Bootstrap_Landing_Page)

### Day 64: May 14, 2017

**Today's Progress**: small tweak to tonomoshia.github.io

**Thoughts:** I usually take Sundays off (not on purpose, it's just  the trend). I just added one line to my github page to make it more responsive.  Also used a different Bootstrap CDN.

### Day 65: May 15, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Worked in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp)

**Thoughts:** Javascript Script Demo page. Just starting in Javascript. Prior lessons were in HTML, CSS (including Bootstrap).

**Link to work:** [Script Demo](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/1_Script_Demo)

### Day 66: May 16, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Did [JS Stalker exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/2_JS_Stalker_Exercise) and [Age Calculator exercise](https://github.com/tonomoshia/ColtSteele/tree/master/3_Javascript/3_Age_Calculator) in [Colt Steele's Web Developer course](https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp). Added Bootstrap to the html, even though that was not required, because I wanted it to look a certain way. Decided to plunk down the money for [Dain Miller's Advanced Beginner Challenge](http://advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/). Included a great video ["The Myth of the 'Real Javascript Developer'](https://youtu.be/Xt5qpbiqw2g)." I worked on Colt's course at lunch.
After work I told my family I had a meetup and went to work by myself at a coffeeshop for another hour to start off the Advanced Beginner Challenge. Was disappointed to find that they changed their hours and now close at 8 p.m. That's why  I only got an hour in. I'm going to do it again on Thursday.

### Day 67: May 17, 2017

**Today's Progress**: 2 units in Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp course, Advanced Beginner Start

**Thoughts:** Boolean Logic and Logical Operators in Colt Steele's course. New concepts: "truthy" and "falsy" values. Falsy values: false, 0, ""(empty string), null, undefined, NaN. Everything else is "truthy".

In Advanced Beginner Challenge, listened to 5 members-only podcasts at work:  (1) Freelancing 101: How to Start Freelancing NOW w/out Knowing Any Programming (2) Updates & the Concept Behind the ABC Course (3) The 1% A Day Formula (4) How to Stop Your Procrastination (5) Mental Framework: KSE - Knowledge, Strategy, Execution. Best ones: Freelancing 101: How to Start Freelancing NOW w/out Knowing Any Programming & The 1% A Day Formula.

**Today's Progress:** [Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy course]((https://www.udemy.com/the-web-developer-bootcamp/), day 4 work of [Advanced Beginner Challenge](https://www.advancedbeginnerchallenge.com/), added projects page (privately as I am still working on it) to [tonomoshia.com](http://www.tonomoshia.com). This is Saturday, so I was planning to get a lot done. I was handicapped by the fact that my Macbook Pro charger stopped working after I dropped it last night, so I was unable to get any coding done at Saturday Coding CLub today. I read a book (Remote) and actually finished it, so there's that. I have only been able to work on my iMac. Nothing wrong with that, but I am able to work anywhere with my Macbook Pro.

> "4. Remember how long thou hast been putting off these things, and how often thou hast received an opportunity from the gods, and yet dost not use it. Thou must now at last perceive of what universe thou art a part, and of what administrator of the universe thy existence is an efflux, and that a limit of time is fixed for thee, which if thou dost not use for clearing away the clouds from thy mind, it will go and thou wilt go, and it will never return."

>   "7. Do the things external which fall upon thee distract thee? Give thyself time to learn something new and good, and cease to be whirled around. But then thou must also avoid being carried about the other way. For those too are triflers who have wearied themselves in life by their activity, and yet have no object to which to direct every movement, and, in a word, all their thoughts."

**Colt Steele's Web Developer Bootcamp Udemy Course:** *Started section 11 on Javascript Arrays.*

1. Unit Objectives (119)
2. Introduction to Arrays (120)
3. Arrays Methods (121): push/pop, shift/unshift, indexOf, and slice.
  * Use _push_ to add to the end of an array. Argument has the item you want to add: array.push("item")
  * Use _pop_ to remove the last item in an array. No argument needed: array.pop()
  * Use _shift_ to remove the first item in an array. No argument needed: array.shift()
  * Use _unshift_ to add to the front of an array. Argument has the item you want to add: array.unshift("item")
  * Use _indexOf_ to find the index of an item in an array. Requires argument (item you are looking for): array.indexOf("item"). Returns "-1" if the element is not present in the array.
  * Use _slice_ to copy parts of an array. var x = y.slice(1, 3); copies items 1 through 3, not including index item 3, in the y array. Slice arguments specify starting and end points and end point is not included. Keep arguments empty if you want to copy the whole array. var x = y.slice() copies all of the y array items to the x array.
4. Arrays Quiz (122)

**Advanced Beginner Challenge:**
1. I did [the suggested tutorial](http://tutorialzine.com/2015/04/first-webapp-react/) to build a Reach app  and . .  it did not work. So there's that. Probably a problem with npm modules that have been deprecated or are not compatible with each other.

2. Watched [ABC Tutorial Section - Introduction](private link)

My MBP is too old for Docker download but I can use Docker with Digital Ocean. (I could also use the downloaded version on my iMac instead but I like portability, so until I get a new MBP . . . .) So when I am ready for that (I have a $50 credit with Digital Ocean due to student status) I will check out this step-by -step [How To Use the DigitalOcean Docker Application](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-the-digitalocean-docker-application). Talked to Steve about this and he said it's because of a chip they started using in MBP in 2011.

### Day 84: June 10, 2017

Saturday Coding Club was great. We had a show-and-tell of apps. [Steve Witte](https://github.com/stevetwitte) showed us his restaurant HR app built in Ruby and Ruby on Rails and [Paul Senior](https://itspaulsenior.wordpress.com/) showed us his Oh Snap app built in JavaScript. We had an interesting discussion about standardization, style guides, learning vanilla JavaScript vs. learning something like Typescript, how ES2015 has still not been adopted by browsers and what we should learn going forward. Didn't do any actual coding at Club today. Was a great meeting of the minds.

Beej keeps a notebook and prepares for every standup. Each day he has listed "done", "doing", and "impedes".

Chelsea responded to her email that her account manager says they are looking for someone with 2 years experience as a Business Analyst, but she will keep my resume on file. After reading her email I realized I left my CSM off the updated resume that I did. Brain fart.

### Day 100: July 1, 2017

At [Saturday Coding Club Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/broward-ruby/events/240992829/) we got a chance to look at the guts of [Steve Witte's](https://github.com/stevetwitte) new side project, a twitter clone for investment time, time spent working on internal software for a company.

I also worked on the migration of [my wordpress.com site](https://www.tonomoshia.com) to a wordpress.org installation](https://www.paralegalprogrammer.com) on Bluehost. I do think some of my posts/pages did not make it over. I created a [staging environment](http://www.paralegalprogrammer.com/staging/1499/), installed a new theme (Bento) set up Google Anlaytics, Jetpack and Akismet and updated some pages and posts. Read the [theme manual for Bento](http://satoristudio.net/bento-manual/)

Finally started my draft on my post about the book Remote. I finished it May 20, but have been unable to sit down and get started. I started today and saved it as a draft. As I have been thinking about over this past 6 weeks, it has been become a gigantic post with resources and ideas that are not from the book. I may make a separate page just for Remote Workers resources to include books, podcasts and groups.

Yay for Day 100. Have not decided what is better. Should I start a new 100, or continue adding days. I have seen both. I have also seen the 301 day challenge. the remaining 64 are used for job search. Also the 100 day deep work challenge. I do feel I need something to keep me moving forward and working on a more or less daily basis. Otherwise I will "get to it when I get to it" and that means not getting to it. I need a commitment. I will think it over over the weekend (4 day weekend!!). I do have an interview on Monday, so good time to take a break so I can freak out about that instead (not really).

## Round 2

2nd Round of #100DaysOfCode is at [Bitbucket repo](https://femmequity@bitbucket.org/femmequity/book_reports/src/5c96c8c819f196bfd706b298b55662996f8ec191/log.md?at=master).
